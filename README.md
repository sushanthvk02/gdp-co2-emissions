# GDP and CO₂ Emissions Project

This repository contains all the materials for my DATA 375 (Introduction to Statistical Computing) project at the University of Arizona.  
The project explores the relationship between a country's GDP and its CO₂ emissions using real-world data, along with regression analysis, simulations, and visualizations.

## Project Goals

- Explore whether GDP is positively correlated with CO₂ emissions across countries and over time.
- Fit linear and log-transformed regression models to understand the relationship.
- Apply simulation techniques (e.g., bootstrap sampling) to assess variability and future scenarios.
- Visualize the patterns across countries and regions.
