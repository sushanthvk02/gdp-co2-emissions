# Does Economic Growth Increase COâ‚‚ Emissions?
### An Analysis of Global GDP and Environmental Impact

This solo project investigates whether economic growth, measured by GDP, is still tightly linked to COâ‚‚ emissions, and whether signs of decoupling are beginning to emerge. It was completed as part of DATA 375: Statistical Computing at the University of Arizona.

##  Project Summary
- Built a merged dataset using public data from the World Bank and Our World in Data (1990â€“2023)
- Explored patterns using time series plots, scatterplots, and summary statistics
- Fitted linear and log-log regression models, including models with population as a second predictor
- Used **Monte Carlo simulation** to estimate COâ‚‚ outcomes under varying GDP growth scenarios
- Applied **bootstrapping** to assess model stability and construct confidence intervals
- Performed **fairness analysis** by comparing COâ‚‚ emissions and GDP on a per capita basis and across income groups
