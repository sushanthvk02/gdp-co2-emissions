# Does Economic Growth Increase CO₂ Emissions?
### An Analysis of Global GDP and Environmental Impact

This solo project investigates whether economic growth, measured by GDP, is still tightly linked to CO₂ emissions, and whether signs of decoupling are beginning to emerge. It was completed as part of DATA 375: Statistical Computing at the University of Arizona.

##  Project Summary
- Built a merged dataset using public data from the World Bank and Our World in Data (1990–2023)
- Explored patterns using time series plots, scatterplots, and summary statistics
- Fitted linear and log-log regression models, including models with population as a second predictor
- Used **Monte Carlo simulation** to estimate CO₂ outcomes under varying GDP growth scenarios
- Applied **bootstrapping** to assess model stability and construct confidence intervals
- Performed **fairness analysis** by comparing CO₂ emissions and GDP on a per capita basis and across income groups
